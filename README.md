# Disease classification using CNN

## Introduction

This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to swiftly and accurately classify diseases in Potato, Tomato, and Bell Pepper crops. Utilizing advanced technology, the CNN is trained on a diverse dataset, recognizing patterns indicative of specific plant diseases. Real-time classification of new images offers immediate insights to farmers, contributing to sustainable farming practices and increased food security. This research combines precision agriculture with technology-driven solutions, potentially revolutionizing plant disease management for a more sustainable agricultural future.
