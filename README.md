# Disease Classification Using CNN for Bell Pepper, Tomato, and Potato

## Overview

In agriculture, early disease detection is critical for maintaining crop health and maximizing yields. This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify diseases in three key crops: Bell Pepper, Tomato, and Potato. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide accurate and prompt identification of diseases, facilitating proactive measures for farmers.

## Features

- **Multi-Crop Classification:**
  - Detects diseases in Bell Pepper, Tomato, and Potato crops.

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
  - Utilizes a CNN architecture for effective image-based disease classification.

- **Real-time Classification:**
  - Enables quick and accurate identification of diseases in real-time scenarios.

- **Diverse Dataset:**
  - Trained on a diverse dataset featuring images of healthy plants and various disease manifestations.
